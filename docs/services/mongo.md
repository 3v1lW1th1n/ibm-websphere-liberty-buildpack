# Binding MongoDB instances to Liberty applications

If you bind a MongoDB service instance to an application, the Liberty buildpack generates the following
configuration elements in the server.xml file. The elements are required to access the database.

* A mongo element with the default hostname and port subelements.
* A mongoDB element.
* A library element with an embedded fileset subelement. The library element is created for the MongoDB driver.
* A featureManager element. The Liberty buildpack also adds the mongodb-2.0 feature to the featureManager element.

In addition, the Liberty buildpack provides the MongoDB driver that is required.

In the dataSource element, the Liberty buildpack generates a JNDI name that is used by your application to access
MongoDB. Because the Liberty buildpack does not have access to the JNDI name that is used by the application,
the Liberty buildpack generates a JNDI name with a convention of mongo/service_name, where service_name is the
name of the bound service. For example, if you bind a MongoDB service that is named mydb to the application,
the Liberty buildpack generates a JNDI name of mongo/mydb. When you develop the application and create the MongoDB
service instance, ensure that the JNDI name that is used by the application to access the database is the same as
the JNDI name that is generated by the Liberty buildpack.

The following example shows the configuration that is generated when an application is pushed to the cloud and is
bound to a MongoDB service instance that is named mydb:

```
    <mongo id='mongo-mydb' libraryRef='mongo-library'
           user='${cloud.services.mydb.connection.user}'
           password='${cloud.services.mydb.connection.password}'>
        <hostNames>${cloud.services.mydb.connection.hosts}</hostNames>
        <ports>${cloud.services.mydb.connection.ports}</ports>
    </mongo>
    
    <mongoDB id='mongo-mydb-db'
             databaseName='${cloud.services.mydb.connection.db}'
             jndiName='mongo/mydb' mongoRef='mongo-mydb'/>
             
    <library id='mongo-library'>
        <fileset id='mongo-fileset' dir='${server.config.dir}/lib'
                 includes='mongo-java-driver-2.12.3.jar'/>
    </library>
```

The configuration elements in the server.xml file use the following IDs and ID formats:

* The mongo element uses a configuration ID of mongo-service_name.
* The mongoDB element uses a configuration ID of myongo-service_name-db.
* The library element uses a configuration ID of mongo-library.
* The fileset element uses a configuration ID of mongo-fileset.
